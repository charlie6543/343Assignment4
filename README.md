A rudimentary library database with good Object-Oriented design principles. Open/closed principle and factory design principle were used to ensure that the program was open for extension but closed for modification. Designed the program from scratch, including UML diagrams and other documentation.

The library holds three different types of books; children's books, fiction books, and periodicals. They can be checked out or returned by patrons. A patron's checkout history can be displayed at any time. Books are sorted within their categories.
The txt files are used to initialize books and patrons, and then run an arbitrary sequence of commands.
